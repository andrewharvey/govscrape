= index/ =
Currently you can get the maps which are indexed in the index/*index.csv files
from the url (replacing $cd_title and $image_id),

http://parishmaps.lands.nsw.gov.au/mrsid/image_sid.pl?client=pmap&image=$cd_title/$image_id.sid

This will give you the MrSID file. I used the MrSID extention to GDAL to convert
them into JPG.

= scraper/ =
The code in scraper was written to generate the index files, and hence download
the MrSID files. I only wrote it to really be run once. If you want to use my
code to scrape the MrSID files, make sure you step through it and think about
what each step will do, don't just run ./scraper.sh as it wasn't designed to be
run like that (and won't work as the cd ../'s have errors).
